DONE --Add a FORESTRY object for dealing with tree related stuff that does not require seq data!!!

NOTE: Clade and branch labels follow the paml format.  # to label a branch.  $ to label a clade (must 
decide if the $ label will be inlcusive or exclusive of ancestral branch).  To start: label types 
cannot be mixed (# or $ only), and only one $ mark allowed!!!


NOTES2:
1. Indeed, because the program keeps the computer running needlessly, it also needlessly 
   increases the entropy of the universe, thereby hastening said heat death. In short, 
   such a program is quite environmentally unfriendly and should be considered a threat 
   to our species. Don't write code like this.

2. Of course, performing any kind of additional work, whether by humans or machines, also
   increases the entropy of the universe, thereby hastening heat death. This is a good 
   argument to keep in mind for times when your employer requests extra overtime.
